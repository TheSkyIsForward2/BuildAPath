**Gallery Shooter Project**

Gallery Shooter called "We Invaders" where you are a pilot flying head first into a swarm of alien ships.
Shoot them down for points, asteroids give more.
Each consecutive wave grants more points per enemy you destroy. 
Collisions with enemies lose a life.
Controls are explained on the page.
